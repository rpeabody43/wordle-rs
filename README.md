### Installation

At the time of writing this README the latest release is v0.1.0

### How to use
The basic loop goes like this:
1. Program comes up with a word
2. You pass along the 'code' that Wordle gives you
   1. Wordle syntax goes like this (case in-sensitive):
   <pre>
   ðŸŸ© (Green) : O

   ðŸŸ¨ (Yellow): -

   â¬› (Gray)  : X

   i.e. a wordle response of ðŸŸ©â¬›â¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬› becomes OXX-O
   </pre>
3. Repeat

#### The program does not always get the answer within 6 tries, but it does get the answer
